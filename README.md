We tried our code in different screen sizes and it was working different for all of us. For some it was working fine and for others it was not working properly.

The group is aware that there is a column-property in CSS, however, the member who wrote the code for the articles in de forskjellige st√∏rrelsene was not aware at the time. We chose to keep the code as it is, since it was working okay.

Due to some technical error other members of the group could not do commits, so that is why one member did all the commits.
